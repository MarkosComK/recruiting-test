# 1.Problem - Analysis:

- The error ERROR_FILE_EXISTS occurs when the GetTempFileName Windows API function tries to _create a temporary file_, but the file _already exists_.This issue seems to be frequent for the specific customer, but not for others. The customer mentioned that they are using a **Clipboard manager tool**, which could be interfering with the file creation process by locking or using the _temporary files_.
    The error occurs on some versions of Windows Server but not on others, indicating that it could be related to **specific system configurations**(/temp/) or **compatibility issues** with the _Clipboard manager tool_.
    The customer does not have administrator rights, but this is likely unrelated since GetTempFileName does not typically require elevated privileges.

## Recommended Solutions:

- ### Clipboard Manager Tool
   Priority: High
   Action: Ask the customer to temporarily disable the Clipboard manager tool and see if the issue persists. Clipboard managers sometimes lock temporary files, causing conflicts with GetTempFileName.

- ### Delete Temp Files in %TEMP%:
    Priority: Medium
    Action: Instruct the customer to delete all **temp files** in the `%TEMP%` folder (C:\Users\AppData\Local\Temp). This could help resolve the issue if temp files are not being cleaned up properly, or the temp folder has reach his limit (65.535 files) during the process. The address of this issue can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.path.gettempfilename?view=net-8.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN#System_IO_Path_GetTempFileName). ⬇️
    - On .NET 7 and earlier versions, when using this method on Windows, the GetTempFileName method raises an IOException if it's used to create more than 65535 files without deleting previous temporary files. This limitation does not exist on operating systems other than Windows. Starting in .NET 8, the limitation does not exist on any operating system.
    
**Registry repair tool**: Unlikely to solve the issue, as the error is related to temporary file creation rather than a registry issue. While it could clean up other unrelated errors, it’s not addressing the cause of the problem.

# 2.Problem - Analysis:

Based on the image description, it appears that the exclamation marks are displayed next to certain numbers like `-2,10!`, `12!`, and `2016,2!`. Given that the numbers are accompanied by exclamation marks, and considering the think-cell documentation on logarithmic scales, here's an analysis of why these specific values are triggering the warnings:

-   **Negative Values (`-2`)**:
    
    -   **Rule Triggered**: Logarithmic scaling cannot represent negative numbers. In the chart, `-2.10` cannot be plotted correctly on a logarithmic axis. Therefore, an exclamation mark appears to warn the user that the negative value is placed at the baseline, as it cannot be part of a logarithmic progression.
    -   **Solution**: Either change the scale to **linear**, or remove the negative values if you want to maintain a logarithmic scale.
-   **Non-Power of 10 ( `1_2!`, `2016,2!`)**:
    
    -   **Rule Triggered**: A logarithmic scale can only have tick marks at powers of 10 (e.g., 1, 10, 100). The numbers `1{2!}`, and `2016,2!` are likely not powers of 10 or are breaking the expected format.
    -   **2016,2!**,  **12!**: This number seems to be improperly placed for a logarithmic scale because it's neither a power of 10 nor in line with logarithmic tick marks.
    -   **Solution**: Adjust the axis so that only powers of 10 (e.g., 1, 10, 100) are displayed on the logarithmic scale, or switch back to a linear scale if non-power-of-10 numbers need to be represented.
User can address to think-cell documentation to understand more about the exclamation mark [HERE](https://www.think-cell.com/en/resources/manual/chartdecorations) look for **(8.1.5 Logarithmic Scale)**

The priority for this solutions are based difficulty to apply them and on a eliminatory aspect.
